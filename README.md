# Functional use for lib

Here is the study and test of two necessary flies logic, apply functional rules and libs to made it more robust.

- pagination: wich is use either rule functor.
- kalendar: wich use compose rule, and at last im moving the moment dependency.


Uses **ramda-fantasy** to include Either.
Made an approach of **jsverify** for robusts tests.

(moment is only using in test **logic not!**)
